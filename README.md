## Welcome to my small project!
<br>
After going through a Web Dev Bootcamp, for full stack web development, I found a strong interest within React. I throughly enjoy React as it is a comfortable library, which allows me to build large and small scale projects alike with ease. Thus I enrolled in a React.JS advanced course. This is one of the first on-your-own coding challenges.

## What this project entails
<br>
This project is a developer card which shows a picture, a small bio, and the skillset, or languages. It uses the React library, in CodeSandbox, to create a React App.

## Whats the point???
<br>
The point of this project was to create a developer card, with multiple components. The challenge was to break these components down into their own functions within the app, so that certain data may be passed to the components. The data ranged from h1's to paragraphs, to css styles, and props.

## What are props?
<br> 
The main idea, was working with props, or properties. Props are a set of data, in the form of an object which is passed into a component. If you look at the bottom of the card, which I will attach a picture below, you will see an in-line list of skills/languages. Instead of coding out each individual skill, I made a skill list with properties attached such as, skill language, skill background color, and skill level emoji. I then created another component, which passes through properties from the skillset list, for each individual skill, thus it slightly shortens, and cleans up the code. These properties were called by using props.lang, props.bgColor, and props.emoji.

## My takeaway
<br> 
React, unlike vanilla JS allows you to funnel, or nest components, which their properties are determined by their parent componenets, via a One-Way data flow. This means the data is immunable is only determined by the parent component, not by the child compenent. This makes code easier to read, and makes things like bugging or editing code, much easier!
